This package provides an easy way to build Wt and all its
dependencies, to try out the library and run its examples.

0. When checking out from git
-----------------------------

  $ aclocal
  $ autoconf

I. Building and installing Wt and its dependencies
--------------------------------------------------

To build Wt and all its dependencies, you need to run:

  $ ./configure --prefix=$PWD/install --with-version=3.1.5
  $ make all

You can chose any wt version or 'git' for using the latest git development
version.

Running just 'make' will show the different targets

If you want to install Wt in a place that requires privileges, and do not
want to use these privileges when simply building, you can break it down in
the following parts:

  $ ./configure --prefix=/opt/wt/
  $ make deps
  $ sudo make deps-install
  $ make wt
  $ sudo make wt-install

II. Running the examples
------------------------

To run one of the examples:

 ./run-example --list
 ./run-example mandelbrot
