Building and installing Wt and its dependencies
-----------------------------------------------

To build Wt and all its dependencies, you need to run:

 ./configure --prefix=/home/koen/wt
 make install

If you want to install Wt in a place that requires privileges, and do not
want to sudo everything, you can break it down in the following parts:

 ./configure --prefix=/opt/wt/
 make deps
 sudo make deps-install
 make wt
 sudo make install
