This package provides an easy way to build Wt and all its dependencies,
to try out the library and run its examples.

Building and installing Wt and its dependencies
-----------------------------------------------

To build Wt and all its dependencies, you need to run:

 ./configure --prefix=/home/koen/wt
 make all

Running just 'make' will show the different targets

If you want to install Wt in a place that requires privileges, and do not
want to sudo everything, you can break it down in the following parts:

 ./configure --prefix=/opt/wt/
 make deps
 sudo make deps-install
 make wt
 sudo make wt-install

Running the examples
--------------------

To run one of the examples:

 ./run-example --list
 ./run-example mandelbrot
